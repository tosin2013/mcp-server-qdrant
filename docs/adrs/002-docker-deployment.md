# ADR-002: Docker Deployment Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The MCP server for Qdrant needs to be containerized for consistent deployment across different environments. We need to establish a standardized approach for Docker deployment that ensures security, performance, and maintainability.

## Decision

### Base Image Selection
We will use `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` as our base image [1], which provides:
- Minimal image size
- Latest security updates
- Official Python support
- Debian-based system compatibility

### Docker Build Strategy
1. **Multi-stage Build**
   ```dockerfile
   # Build stage
   FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm AS builder
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY pyproject.toml .
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -e .
   
   # Runtime stage
   FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=builder /app /app
   ```

2. **Security Measures**
   - Run container as non-root user
   - Implement health checks
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities
   - Use secrets management

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Layer caching for dependencies
   - Minimal image size
   - Resource limits configuration

### Container Configuration
1. **Environment Variables**
   - Use `.env` files for development
   - Use Kubernetes secrets for production
   - Configure through environment variables

2. **Resource Management**
   - Set memory limits
   - Configure CPU allocation
   - Implement graceful shutdown

3. **Monitoring and Health**
   - Implement Docker health checks
   - Export metrics for monitoring
   - Configure logging to stdout/stderr

### CI/CD Integration
1. **Build Process**
   - Automated builds on commits
   - Version tagging
   - Security scanning
   - Registry push automation

2. **Testing**
   - Run tests in container
   - Integration testing
   - Security scanning

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent deployment environment
- Improved security through isolation
- Easy scaling and orchestration
- Simplified dependency management
- Reproducible builds

### Negative
- Additional complexity in build process
- Learning curve for Docker best practices
- Increased build time with multi-stage builds
- Additional monitoring requirements

## Implementation Notes
1. Create base Dockerfile
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline
3. Implement security scanning
4. Document deployment procedures
5. Create container health checks
