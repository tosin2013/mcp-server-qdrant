# ADR-001: Project Structure and Testing Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The MCP server for Qdrant requires a well-organized project structure and comprehensive testing strategy to ensure reliability and maintainability. We need to establish patterns for code organization, testing, and documentation.

Following the principles outlined in [evidence-based-decision-making](https://endjin.com/blog/2024/03/adr-a-dotnet-tool-for-creating-and-managing-architecture-decision-records), we aim to document our architectural decisions in a formalized way.

## Decision

### Project Structure
We will organize the project with the following structure, based on Python best practices and maintainable project organization:
zoh
```
mcp-server-qdrant/
├── docs/
│   └── adrs/           # Architecture Decision Records
├── src/
│   └── mcp_server_qdrant/
│       ├── core/       # Core business logic
│       ├── models/     # Data models and schemas
│       ├── services/   # Service layer implementations
│       ├── utils/      # Utility functions
│       └── main.py     # Application entry point
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/          # Unit tests
│   ├── integration/   # Integration tests
│   └── conftest.py    # Test fixtures and configuration
├── .github/           # GitHub Actions and workflows
├── .gitignore        # Git ignore file
├── LICENSE           # Project license
├── README.md         # Project documentation
├── pyproject.toml    # Project configuration and dependencies
└── Dockerfile        # Container configuration
```

### Testing Strategy
1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
   - Write tests before implementing features
   - Use pytest as the testing framework
   - Maintain test coverage above 80%

2. **Test Categories**
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for Qdrant interactions
   - End-to-end tests for MCP protocol compliance

3. **Testing Tools**
   - pytest for test execution
   - pytest-asyncio for async test support
   - pytest-cov for coverage reporting
   - MCP inspector for protocol compliance testing

4. **Continuous Integration**
   - Run tests on every pull request
   - Enforce code coverage requirements
   - Validate code style with pre-commit hooks

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear organization of code and responsibilities
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability
- Easy onboarding for new contributors
- Automated quality checks reduce bugs
- Enables distributed and asynchronous development processes [1]

### Negative
- Initial setup time required for test infrastructure
- Maintenance overhead for test suite
- Learning curve for TDD practices

## Implementation Notes
1. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
2. Configure pre-commit hooks for code quality
3. Create test templates and examples
4. Document testing practices in README
